# Take input of weights of 11 people and then print their average and then check whether the average weight is a multiple of 5 or not? This means that when you will divide the average weight by 5, the remainder should be 0.
# Note :-

# Here you have to use input function. You can also use raw input to take the weights as inputs, inside the loop.


# i=0
# sum=0
# while i<11:
#     num=int(input("please enter the number"))
#     if i%5==0:
#        print(sum,"weights of 11 people")   
#     sum=sum+i
#     i=i+1
