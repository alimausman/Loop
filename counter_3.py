# Make a loop that inputs 10 numbers. After taking the input prints the sum of all those numbers.

# This program will run like this. Everytime use input() to take the numbers as an input.


# i=1
# sum=0
# while i<=10:
#     num=int(input("please enter the number"))
#     sum=sum+num
#     i=i+1
#     print(sum)
